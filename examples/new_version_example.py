New Version Example - TBH Secure Agents

This example demonstrates all the key features of the latest version of the TBH Secure Agents framework
in a simple, readable way without any fancy elements.

Features demonstrated:
1. Basic usage (Experts, Operations, Squad)
2. Security profiles (minimal security for simplicity)
3. Guardrails (template variables and conditional formatting)
4. Result destination (saving results to files in various formats)

To run this example:
1. Make sure you have set your Google API key as an environment variable:
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   NOTE: You need a valid Google API key to use the Gemini model.
   You can get an API key from the Google AI Studio: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

2. Run the script: python examples/new_version_example.py
