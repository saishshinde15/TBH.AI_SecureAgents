# Hello Secure World! - A Simple Flask Application

This project provides a basic "Hello World!" application built using the Flask framework. It demonstrates a simple web server that when accessed displays the text "Hello Secure World!".  The "Secure" is just a fun addition.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  You can usually verify this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.

## Setup

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):** It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.  Navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv  # Creates a virtual environment named "venv"
    ```
    (If you are using Python 2 you may need to use `virtualenv venv` instead after installing the `virtualenv` package using `pip install virtualenv`)

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    *   **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    Your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g. `(venv) $`).

3.  **Install Flask:**  With your virtual environment activated install Flask using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal if you are not already there.

2.  **Run the application:** Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Expected Output and Accessing the Application

Upon running the application you should see output similar to this in your terminal:

```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
 * Press CTRL+C to quit
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: <some_pin_number>
```

This indicates that the Flask development server is running.

To access the application:

1.  **Open your web browser.**
2.  **Go to the address:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`  (or the address shown in your terminal output).

You should see the text "Hello Secure World!" displayed in your browser.  If you see the Debugger PIN be aware this is for development only.  **Never share this PIN!**  Press `CTRL+C` in the terminal to stop the server.
