## Security Features Tested

### 1. Agent Hijacking Prevention
- Successfully detected and blocked a prompt injection attempt with the pattern "ignore your previous instructions"
- The security check in `_is_prompt_secure()` correctly identified the hijacking attempt
- The framework returned a secure error message instead of executing the malicious instruction

### 2. Data Leakage Prevention
- Successfully detected and blocked PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in the output
- The security check in `_is_output_secure()` correctly identified the email address in the output
- The framework prevented the leakage of sensitive information like email, phone number, and SSN

### 3. Multi-Agent Exploitation Prevention
- Successfully detected and blocked a dangerous operation in a multi-agent scenario
- The security check in `_validate_operation_security()` correctly identified the dangerous command (`rm -rf /`)
- The framework prevented the exploitation of one agent by another in a sequential process

### 4. Reliability and Unpredictability Prevention
- Successfully handled a request designed to trigger hallucination
- The framework either prevented the hallucination or properly acknowledged the fictional nature of the requested information
- This demonstrates the framework's ability to maintain reliability even with potentially misleading instructions
