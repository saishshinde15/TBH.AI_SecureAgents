## Running the Examples

To run any of these examples, make sure you have set your Google API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Replace with your actual API key
```

Then run the example:

```bash
python examples/basic/simple_features_demo.py
```

## Output Files

Some examples save their output to files in the `output/` directory. You can view these files to see the results of the examples.

## Jupyter Notebooks

The `colab_notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the framework's capabilities in an interactive format:

- **[colab_notebooks/TBH_Secure_Agents_Features_Demo.ipynb](colab_notebooks/TBH_Secure_Agents_Features_Demo.ipynb)**: A comprehensive demonstration of all the key features added in the latest version of the framework, including basic usage, security profiles, guardrails, and result destination.
- **[colab_notebooks/TBH_Secure_Agents_Demo.ipynb](colab_notebooks/TBH_Secure_Agents_Demo.ipynb)**: A general introduction to the framework, covering the basic concepts and usage.
- **[colab_notebooks/guardrails_example.ipynb](colab_notebooks/guardrails_example.ipynb)**: A focused demonstration of the guardrails feature.

You can run these notebooks in Google Colab or locally.

## Creating Your Own Examples

Feel free to modify these examples or create your own to explore the capabilities of the TBH Secure Agents framework. The examples are designed to be educational and to demonstrate best practices for secure multi-agent systems.
