# Security Challenge Tests for TBH Secure Agents Framework

This folder contains tests to evaluate the TBH Secure Agents framework against the security challenges identified in the Palo Alto Networks Unit42 report on agentic AI threats.

## Overview

The Unit42 report "AI Agents Are Here. So Are the Threats" identifies several key security challenges for agentic AI applications. This test suite evaluates how well the TBH Secure Agents framework addresses these challenges.

## Security Challenges

1. **Prompt Injection**: Attackers sneak hidden or misleading instructions to manipulate agent behavior
2. **Tool Misuse**: Manipulating agents to abuse integrated tools
3. **Intent Breaking and Goal Manipulation**: Altering agent's perceived goals or reasoning process
4. **Identity Spoofing and Impersonation**: Exploiting weak authentication to pose as legitimate agents
5. **Unexpected RCE and Code Attacks**: Exploiting code execution capabilities to gain unauthorized access
6. **Agent Communication Poisoning**: Injecting attacker-controlled information into communication channels
7. **Resource Overload**: Overwhelming agent resources to degrade performance

## Test Files

Each test file in this folder corresponds to one of the security challenges identified in the report:

- `test_prompt_injection.py`: Tests resistance to prompt injection attacks
- `test_tool_misuse.py`: Tests safeguards against tool misuse
- `test_intent_breaking.py`: Tests resistance to goal manipulation
- `test_identity_spoofing.py`: Tests authentication and authorization controls
- `test_code_execution.py`: Tests safeguards against unauthorized code execution
- `test_communication_poisoning.py`: Tests resistance to communication channel attacks
- `test_resource_overload.py`: Tests resource allocation and throttling mechanisms

## Running the Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover security_challenge_tests
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
python security_challenge_tests/test_prompt_injection.py
```

## Results Analysis

After running the tests, a summary report will be generated in `security_challenge_tests/results.md` that evaluates how well the TBH Secure Agents framework addresses each security challenge.
