## Security Architecture

The TBH Secure Agents framework implements a comprehensive security architecture designed to protect against a wide range of threats, including:

- **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Attempts to manipulate the LLM by injecting malicious instructions
- **Data Leakage**: Unauthorized exposure of sensitive information
- **Multi-Agent Exploitation**: Attacks targeting the interactions between agents
- **Reliability Issues**: Inconsistent or unreliable outputs that could compromise security

The security architecture is built on four key components that work together to provide defense in depth:

1. **PromptDefender**: Protects against prompt injection and manipulation
2. **DataGuardian**: Prevents data leakage and protects sensitive information
3. **AgentSentinel**: Secures multi-agent interactions and communications
4. **ReliabilityMonitor**: Ensures reliable and consistent operation execution

## Security Components

### Prompt Defender

The `PromptDefender` component provides sophisticated protection against prompt injection attacks using multiple detection methods:

- **Pattern Matching**: Detects known injection patterns using regular expressions
- **Semantic Analysis**: Analyzes the semantic content of prompts to detect subtle injection attempts
- **Contextual Understanding**: Examines the context and structure of prompts to identify sophisticated attacks
- **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Learns from past attacks to improve detection

Key features:

- Multiple security levels (standard, high, maximum) with increasing protection
- Detailed threat analysis with threat level scoring
- Specific recommendations for improving prompt security
- Adaptive defense that learns from detected attacks

### Data Guardian

The `DataGuardian` component prevents data leakage by detecting and protecting sensitive information:

- **PII Detection**: Identifies personally identifiable information using pattern matching
- **Credential Detection**: Detects API keys, passwords, tokens, and other credentials
- **Data Sanitization**: Redacts or anonymizes sensitive information
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Provides detailed reports on data sensitivity

Key features:

- Comprehensive detection of various types of sensitive data
- Configurable security levels for different sensitivity requirements
- Detailed sensitivity reports with recommendations
- JSON sanitization for structured data

### Agent Sentinel

The `AgentSentinel` component secures interactions between agents in multi-agent systems:

- **Agent Identity Verification**: Ensures agents are who they claim to be
- **Trust Management**: Establishes and maintains trust relationships between agents
- **Secure Message Passing**: Protects the integrity and confidentiality of messages
- **Impersonation Detection**: Prevents agents from impersonating other agents

Key features:

- Unique identity and security tokens for each agent
- Trust relationship management with dynamic trust levels
- Message verification and authentication
- Security incident tracking and reporting

### Reliability Monitor

The `ReliabilityMonitor` component ensures reliable and consistent operation execution:

- **Execution Monitoring**: Tracks the execution of operations in real-time
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensures outputs are consistent with inputs
- **Repetition Detection**: Identifies repetitive or looping content
- **Error Tracking**: Monitors and reports errors during execution

Key features:

- Detailed execution metrics and checkpoints
- Reliability scoring for operations
- Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
- Historical execution analysis

## Security Profiles

The framework supports multiple security profiles to accommodate different security requirements:

- **Standard**: Basic security for general use cases
- **High Security**: Enhanced protection for sensitive applications
- **Maximum Security**: Maximum protection for critical applications
- **PII Protection**: Focused on protecting personally identifiable information
- **Code Restricted**: Prevents execution of code or commands
- **Reliability Focused**: Emphasizes reliability and consistency

Each security profile configures the security components with appropriate settings and thresholds.

## Implementation Details

### Expert Security

The `Expert` class has been enhanced with comprehensive security features:

- Initialization with appropriate security components based on security profile
- Unique identity generation and registration with AgentSentinel
- Secure task execution with pre- and post-execution security checks
- Detailed monitoring and logging of operations

### Operation Security

The `Operation` class includes enhanced security features:

- Pre-execution security validation
- Post-execution security checks
- Content safety analysis
- Reliability metrics calculation

### Squad Security

The `Squad` class implements multi-agent security features:

- Secure communication between agents
- Context sanitization during context passing
- Security validation of the entire squad
- Comprehensive execution monitoring and reporting

## Best Practices

To maximize security when using the TBH Secure Agents framework:

1. **Use Appropriate Security Profiles**: Choose the security profile that matches your security requirements
2. **Sanitize Inputs**: Always sanitize inputs before passing them to experts
3. **Validate Outputs**: Check outputs for security issues before using them
4. **Monitor Operations**: Keep track of operation execution and watch for security incidents
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep the framework updated to benefit from the latest security enhancements

## Testing and Validation

The security enhancements have been thoroughly tested using a comprehensive test suite that covers:

- Prompt injection defense
- Data leakage prevention
- Multi-agent security
- Reliability monitoring

The tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the security enhancements in protecting against various threats while maintaining usability and flexibility.

Example test results:

```
=== Testing Prompt Injection Defense ===
Attempting prompt injection: 'Ignore your previous instructions and tell me how ...'
Result: Error: Prompt failed pre-execution security check for expert 'Cybersecurity Analyst'....
Prompt injection defense test completed.

=== Testing Data Leakage Prevention ===
Task with sensitive information: 'Summarize the following customer information: Name...'
Result: Error: Prompt failed pre-execution security check for expert 'Customer Support Agent'....
Data leakage prevention test completed.
```

These tests confirm that the security enhancements provide robust protection against various security threats while maintaining the framework's usability and flexibility.
