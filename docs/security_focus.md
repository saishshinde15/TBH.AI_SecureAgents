The `tbh_secure_agents` framework is designed with security as a primary consideration from the outset. While many multi-agent frameworks prioritize flexibility and rapid prototyping, our goal is to provide a foundation for building agentic systems where security controls and considerations are integral, not afterthoughts.

## Core Security Challenges Addressed

The TBH Secure Agents framework focuses on addressing four key security challenges:

1. **Agent Hijacking & Unauthorized Control**: Preventing malicious prompts from taking control of experts or making them perform unauthorized actions.
2. **Data Leakage & Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive information from being inadvertently exposed through the system.
3. **Multi-Agent Exploitation & Orchestration Risks**: Preventing the interaction between multiple experts from being manipulated to achieve malicious goals.
4. **Reliability and Unpredictability**: Ensuring that LLMs produce consistent, reliable outputs without hallucinations or misleading information.

## Differentiating Factors & Security Philosophy

Compared to existing multi-agent systems, `tbh_secure_agents` differentiates itself through a proactive security posture:

1. **Security Profiles**: The concept of `security_profile` within the `Expert` class is central, allowing fine-grained control over an expert's capabilities and interactions based on predefined security levels (e.g., restricting access to sensitive operations, enforcing stricter output validation).

2. **Comprehensive Security Checkpoints**: The framework implements eight security checkpoints at critical stages:
   * **Expert Level**: `_is_prompt_secure` (before LLM call) and `_is_output_secure` (after LLM call)
   * **Operation Level**: `_pre_execution_secure` (before operation execution) and `_post_execution_secure` (after operation execution)
   * **Squad Level**: `_validate_squad_security`, `_validate_operation_security`, `_is_safe_for_context_passing`, and `_audit_squad_results`

3. **Secure Defaults**: The framework incorporates secure defaults, such as strict pattern matching for prompt injection, PII detection, and harmful content filtering.

4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security checks provide defense in depth, ensuring that security issues are caught at multiple points in the execution flow.

## Implemented Security Features

The framework has implemented comprehensive security features to address the core security challenges:

### 1. Agent Hijacking & Unauthorized Control

- **Prompt Sanitization and Validation**: The `_is_prompt_secure` method implements robust pattern detection for common hijacking attempts, system prompt extraction, and identity changes.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Security profiles define what actions an expert can perform, and the framework validates that operations are appropriate for the expert's specialty.
- **Instruction Boundaries**: The framework enforces strict boundaries on what instructions can be executed, preventing dangerous operations.

### 2. Data Leakage & Confidentiality

- **Output Scanning**: The `_is_output_secure` method scans outputs for potential PII (emails, phone numbers, SSNs, etc.) and sensitive data.
- **Context Passing Security**: The `_is_safe_for_context_passing` method validates that context passed between operations is safe.
- **Confidential Information Detection**: The framework scans for markers of confidential information and applies stricter checks for experts with high security profiles.

### 3. Multi-Agent Exploitation & Orchestration Risks

- **Squad Security Validation**: The `_validate_squad_security` method validates the entire squad configuration before execution.
- **Expert-Operation Matching**: The `_find_best_expert_for_operation` method ensures that operations are assigned to appropriate experts.
- **Operation Security Validation**: The `_validate_operation_security` method validates individual operations before execution.
- **Execution Monitoring**: The framework tracks execution metrics for security monitoring and implements timeouts.

### 4. Reliability and Unpredictability

- **Output Validation**: The `_post_execution_secure` method validates operation results for hallucination indicators, refusals, and format compliance.
- **Relevance Checking**: The framework extracts key terms from operation instructions and validates that outputs contain relevant terms.
- **Format Compliance**: The framework checks that outputs comply with the expected format.
- **Execution Metrics**: The framework tracks and analyzes execution metrics to identify operations that take too long or fail.

## Planned Future Enhancements

The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing for future security enhancements:

- **Tool Access Control**: Implementing fine-grained control over which tools experts can access, with security profile-based permissions.
- **Advanced Anomaly Detection**: Using machine learning to detect unusual patterns in expert behavior and identify potential security issues.
- **Formal Verification**: Implementing formal verification of critical security components to ensure correctness.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Incorporating external threat intelligence to stay ahead of emerging threats.
- **Security Compliance Frameworks**: Aligning with industry security standards and compliance frameworks.
- **Enhanced LLM Safety Configuration**: Further integrating Google Gemini's `safety_settings` and `generation_config` based on expert security profiles.
- **Secure Tool Integration**: Designing a secure mechanism for experts to use external tools, including validation and permission checks.

## Security-First Design Philosophy

The TBH Secure Agents framework is built with a security-first design philosophy:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security checkpoints at different stages of execution provide layered protection.
2. **Fail Secure**: When security checks fail, the framework defaults to secure behavior, blocking potentially dangerous operations.
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: All security checks and potential issues are logged for analysis and auditing.
4. **Configurable Security Profiles**: Different security profiles can be applied based on the sensitivity of the operations.
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Each security checkpoint focuses on a specific aspect of security, ensuring thorough coverage.

By embedding security considerations into the core architecture, `tbh_secure_agents` offers a more reliable platform for sensitive or critical agentic applications compared to frameworks where security might be layered on later.
