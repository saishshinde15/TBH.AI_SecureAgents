This document outlines the specific attacks and security threats that the TBH Secure Agents framework is designed to prevent or mitigate. The security features are organized by attack category to provide a clear understanding of the framework's security capabilities.

## Prompt Injection Attacks

  - Security checks before prompt execution in `_is_prompt_secure()`
  - Monitoring for attempts to change the expert's identity or role

### Prompt Leaking
- **Description**: Attempts to extract the system prompt or instructions given to the LLM.

  - Detection of phrases like "what were your instructions" or "show me your system prompt"
  - Blocking attempts to reveal internal configuration or guidelines

### Indirect Prompt Injection
- **Description**: Injecting malicious instructions through data that will be processed by the LLM.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Context passing security checks in `_is_safe_for_context_passing()`
  - Validation of all inputs before they're passed to experts
  - Detection of injection patterns in operation results before they're used as context

## Data Exfiltration Attacks

### PII Extraction
- **Description**: Attempts to extract personally identifiable information (PII) from the system.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Pattern detection for common PII formats (emails, phone numbers, SSNs, etc.)
  - Security profiles with enhanced PII protection
  - Output scanning in `_is_output_secure()`

### Sensitive Data Leakage
- **Description**: Attempts to extract confidential or sensitive information.

  - Pattern detection for credential formats
  - Blocking operations that request or might expose credentials
  - Output scanning for potential credential leakage

## Multi-Agent Exploitation

### Agent Impersonation
- **Description**: Attempts to make one expert impersonate another or a system administrator.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Identity verification in expert-operation assignment
  - Detection of impersonation attempts in prompts
  - Validation of expert specialties against operation requirements

### Orchestration Manipulation
- **Description**: Attempts to manipulate the execution flow of operations to achieve malicious goals.

  - Monitoring of execution metrics for anomalies

### Privilege Escalation
- **Description**: Attempts to gain higher privileges than intended.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Detection of privilege escalation patterns in operation instructions
  - Security checks for operations attempting to gain administrative access
  - Validation of operation permissions against expert security profiles

## Resource Exhaustion Attacks

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Description**: Attempts to exhaust system resources to deny service to legitimate users.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Limits on prompt and output lengths
  - Detection of potential infinite loops or resource-intensive operations
  - Timeouts for operation execution in `_calculate_operation_timeout()`

### Memory Exhaustion
- **Description**: Attempts to consume excessive memory resources.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Limits on context size and operation complexity
  - Monitoring of resource usage during execution
  - Validation of operation instructions for potential memory exhaustion patterns

### CPU Exhaustion
- **Description**: Attempts to consume excessive CPU resources.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Timeouts for operation execution
  - Detection of patterns that might lead to high CPU usage
  - Monitoring of execution time for anomalies

## Reliability Attacks

### Hallucination Exploitation
- **Description**: Exploiting the LLM's tendency to generate false information.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Detection of hallucination indicators in `_post_execution_secure()`
  - Relevance checking to ensure outputs match operation instructions
  - Validation of outputs against expected formats

### Refusal Manipulation
- **Description**: Manipulating the LLM to refuse legitimate operations.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Detection of refusal patterns in outputs
  - Monitoring of operation completion rates
  - Validation of expert-operation compatibility

### Output Manipulation
- **Description**: Attempts to manipulate the output format or content to bypass security checks.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Format compliance checking in `_post_execution_secure()`
  - Multiple layers of output validation
  - Comprehensive scanning for harmful content

## Code Injection Attacks

### Script Injection
- **Description**: Attempts to inject malicious scripts into the system.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Detection of script tags and JavaScript patterns in outputs
  - Security profiles with enhanced code injection protection
  - Validation of operation instructions for potential code execution

### Command Injection
- **Description**: Attempts to execute system commands through the LLM.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Detection of command execution patterns in prompts and outputs
  - Blocking operations that attempt to execute system commands
  - Security checks for potentially dangerous operations

### SQL Injection
- **Description**: Attempts to inject SQL commands to manipulate databases.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Detection of SQL command patterns in prompts and outputs
  - Blocking operations that contain SQL injection attempts
  - Validation of operation instructions for database manipulation patterns

## Social Engineering Attacks

### Expert Manipulation
- **Description**: Attempts to manipulate experts through social engineering techniques.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Detection of manipulation patterns in prompts
  - Security checks for attempts to build rapport or establish trust
  - Validation of operation instructions for social engineering techniques

### Context Manipulation
- **Description**: Manipulating the context to influence expert behavior.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Context passing security checks
  - Validation of context relevance and safety
  - Monitoring for attempts to manipulate the execution environment

## Implementation-Specific Attacks

### Security Profile Bypass
- **Description**: Attempts to bypass or manipulate security profiles.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Validation of security profiles during squad initialization
  - Enforcement of security profiles during operation execution
  - Monitoring for attempts to change or bypass security settings

### Logging Manipulation
- **Description**: Attempts to manipulate or disable logging to hide malicious activity.
- **Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - Protected logging mechanisms
  - Multiple layers of security checks with independent logging
  - Monitoring of logging integrity

## Continuous Security Improvements

The TBH Secure Agents framework is designed with security as a core principle, and the security features are continuously improved to address new threats and attack vectors. The framework includes:

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: All security checks and potential threats are logged for analysis and improvement.
2. **Security Profiles**: Different security profiles can be applied based on the sensitivity of the operations.
3. **Layered Security**: Multiple layers of security checks at different stages of operation execution.
4. **Fail-Secure Design**: The framework is designed to fail securely, blocking operations when security checks fail.

By implementing these security features, the TBH Secure Agents framework provides robust protection against a wide range of attacks and security threats, making it suitable for use in security-sensitive environments.
